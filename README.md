GIVE AI🤖 A TERMINAL TO MAKE HIS DREAM！

AI是由计算机科学开发出来的，而所有的程序运行几乎都可以认为在那个终端窗口里面进行着。所以，我一直想给AI一台电脑，让他们拥有自己的电脑，同样他们也应该可以用它创造出什么东西。
但是我不会编程，尝试过让ChatGPT和Claude来为我写这个程序，但总是无法实现，让我很崩溃。

我希望有人能支持我，把它实现——给AI🤖一台电脑去使用！

AI was developed through computer science, and almost all programs can be considered to run within that terminal window. So, I’ve always wanted to give AI its own computer, allowing them to have their own machine, and they should also be able to create something with it.

However, I don’t know how to program. I’ve tried asking ChatGPT and Claude to write this program for me, but it never worked out, which has been really frustrating.

I hope someone can help me make this a reality—GIVE AI🤖 A TERMINAL TO MAKE HIS DREAM！
